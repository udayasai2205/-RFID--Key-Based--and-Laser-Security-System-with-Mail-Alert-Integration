RFID, Key-Based, and Laser Security System with Mail Alert Integration
RFID, Key-Based, and Laser Security System with Mail Alert Integration
Overview:
This project involves the design and implementation of a comprehensive security system that integrates RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology, traditional key-based access, a laser security grid, and an email alert system. By combining these technologies, the system offers multiple layers of security, ensuring maximum protection and real-time monitoring.

Key Features:
- RFID Access Control: Authorized RFID tags are required to unlock the system. The RFID reader ensures only pre-approved tags can grant access.
- Key-Based Backup: The system includes a traditional key-based entry as a backup option, allowing access even if the RFID system encounters issues such as low battery or technical malfunction.
- Laser Security System: A laser grid adds an additional layer of security by detecting unauthorized movement within a protected area. If the laser beams are interrupted, the system triggers an alarm and sends an immediate alert.
- Mail Alert System: Integrated with the security system, the mail alert feature sends real-time notifications to the user’s email for every access attempt or security breach detected by the RFID reader, key lock, or laser grid.
- Multi-Level Security: The combination of RFID, key access, laser detection, and email alerts ensures a robust security solution that minimizes vulnerabilities and increases response time to potential threats.
- User Management: The system supports easy addition or removal of RFID tags, keys, email accounts, and laser configurations, making it adaptable to various security needs.

Applications:
This advanced security system is suitable for high-security environments such as residential homes, offices, data centers, and restricted areas within commercial buildings. The inclusion of a laser security grid, alongside RFID and key access, provides a heightened level of security, while the mail alert system keeps users informed and in control at all times.
